# record-tuple-size-test

The [Haskell record variant comparison spreadsheet][1] claimed that records and
tuples have at most 63 fields.  The aim of this was to verify or refute that
assertion.

The results so far have been that tuples have a maximum of 62 fields, not 63, but
no upper limit on the number of fields on a record has yet been found.
